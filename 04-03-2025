# Agenda

What are the topics to be discussed?

This briefing document summarizes a discussion centered on an upcoming unrestricted solicitation from the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) for training and technical assistance (TTA) across 12 regions. Swami Swaminatan (Verve) initiated the conversation, outlining Verve's strategy to pursue these opportunities, highlighting their existing TTA experience with the VA and the need for a partner with strong ACF past performance, specifically in Head Start. Radiant Digital, represented by Shankar, Tarin, and Nari, expressed strong interest in partnering as a subcontractor, emphasizing their existing relationships and subcontracting experience within ACF, including Head Start. Caliber, through Jan, also indicated interest and relevant experience in HHS. The discussion covered the competitive landscape, the recent amendments to the solicitation, and potential teaming arrangements.

# Notes

**1. ACF Opportunity - Training and Technical Assistance (TTA):**

- The opportunity is for TTA services across 12 regions within ACF.
- The solicitation is currently unrestricted, with 12 contracts expected to be awarded.
- Swami (Verve) has been tracking this opportunity and has connections within ACF (Demetrius and Christine).
- Verve has identified training and technical assistance as a core offering, drawing on their prime contract experience with the VA's suicide prevention program.
- The deadline for proposal submission has been moved, and amendments with Q&A have been released.

**Quote:** *"One of our core offering is training training and technical assistance that we do for VA right that's our prime contract so we have a pretty strong uh qualification experience in in doing that..."* - Swami Swaminatan

**2. Verve's Strategy and Needs:**

- Verve is strategically targeting four regions, including regions 7 and 10 (considered straightforward) and regions 1 and 4 (considered more complex, which can then be leveraged for other regions).
- Verve has identified a critical gap in their team: **ACF past performance**, particularly with Head Start.
- They are also lacking prime contract experience specifically within ACF.
- Verve has been in discussions with other potential team members, including Caliber.
- Swami has spoken with large companies with ACF presence who reportedly are not pursuing this opportunity, suggesting a potentially less crowded competitive landscape than expected.

**Quote:** *"So what we are missing in the mix of things is a company with ACF best performance. Neither of us caliber or us or even the other two companies that we have on the team they don't have ACF. best performance, right?"* - Swami Swaminatan

**3. Radiant Digital's Interest and Capabilities:**

- Radiant Digital has a strong interest in supporting Verve as a subcontractor.
- They possess **existing subcontracting experience within ACF**, including in the Head Start program.
- Radiant Digital has experience across commercial, federal, state, and local markets, with a federal presence primarily in Health and Human Services (HHS) and Treasury.
- They have a digital experience focus (customer experience, UI), application data, and infrastructure capabilities, which they believe are transferable between commercial and federal sectors.
- Radiant also has technical assistance qualifications through their work with the Administration for Community Living (ACL).
- They have a history of work with Florida's Department of Children and Families (DCF) involving data collection and auditing.

**Quote:** *"So we are given that we have been in the ACF now for quite some time you know uh again we don't have a prime position there. We are a subcontractor in two you know u uh now is it two or three in different programs. you know um yeah u you're correct yeah so um one of the reasons why we never really touched TTA even the last time it came was there is an unspoken rule in SCF that people who are doing technology work or any other program work should not be doing uh uh TTA work..."* - Shankar Rashakunda

**Quote:** *"We certainly know some of the players and what they do and we also have our own uh techn you know with ACL we have our own technical assistance qualifications there as well. We have a pretty strong understanding of the head start program having been there and everything. So yeah I mean uh we'll be happy to support you as a sub swami."* - Shankar Rashakunda

**4. Caliber's Interest and Capabilities:**

- Caliber, represented by Jan, is also interested in supporting the ACF opportunity.
- They have experience supporting HHS at PSC and NIH, with several subcontracts at NIH.
- Caliber also holds a prime contract at HHS for tech assessment and workforce assessment.
- They possess strong capabilities in quality and training, digital transformation, and logistics (with significant experience at DoD that they are interested in bringing to HHS).

**Quote:** *"Really interested in supporting ACF. We have strong strong quality and training. We also have strong walls in digital transformation and logistics. So most of our logistics work is large and working at DoD. So would love to bring that over into the HHS space."* - Jan

**5. Competitive Landscape Insights:**

- Swami (Verve) believes the number of bidders might be lower than expected, potentially around 10-12 proposals.
- He suggests that many companies with relevant experience might not be pursuing this opportunity due to other ongoing proposals (e.g., at CMS) or a perceived "unspoken rule" within ACF regarding TTA work.
- ICF is expected to be a major competitor, potentially bidding on multiple regions.
- BCT (Booz Allen Hamilton) is also mentioned as a strong potential competitor.
- Swami indicated that ACF has historically struggled to get Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs) to respond to solicitations.

**Quote:** *"My guess is that probably maybe they may get um you know, 10 proposals, right? So, maybe 12 maximum."* - Swami Swaminatan

**Quote:** *"there is an unspoken rule in SCF that people who are doing technology work or any other program work should not be doing uh uh TTA work..."* - Shankar Rashakunda

**6. Teaming Strategy and Next Steps:**

- Verve is looking to finalize their teaming agreement, with Radiant Digital being a key potential partner to fill the ACF past performance gap.
- Swami will follow up with an NDA and a draft Teaming Agreement Memorandum (TAM) for Shankar (Radiant) to review.
- Jennifer, Verve's proposal lead, will then integrate Radiant into the data calls and proposal development process.

**7. Additional Discussion Points:**

- Shankar (Radiant) expressed interest in a separate discussion with Swami regarding Verve's suicide prevention work at the VA and Radiant's digital health communication capabilities.
- Tarin (Radiant) suggested a separate meeting to discuss potential opportunities at CMS, given Swami's extensive experience there.
- The participants acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding government contracting, referencing the phrase "Come September."
- Jan (Caliber) mentioned a personal connection (second cousin, Parvati) who is strong in CMS.

**Conclusion:**

The discussion indicates a strong mutual interest between Verve and Radiant Digital to team on the upcoming ACF TTA solicitation. Verve identifies Radiant's existing ACF subcontracting experience, particularly with Head Start, as a critical asset to complement their own TTA expertise and small business qualifications. Radiant Digital is eager to support Verve as a subcontractor, leveraging their relevant experience and capabilities. Caliber also expressed interest in contributing to the effort. The next steps involve formalizing the teaming agreement and integrating Radiant Digital into Verve's proposal development process. The potentially lower-than-expected competition offers a favorable outlook for a well-positioned team.
